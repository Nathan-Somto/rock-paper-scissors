a  short intro to my project
This is a Browser Console Based game of Rock Paper Scissors.
You will play the game through a Browser alert and prompt.
you can specify how many rounds you want to play.
I know it does not have much functionality yet but UI will be built in the future

the Game was Created Using Pure Html and Javascript
